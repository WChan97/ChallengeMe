# Challenger App

What is this?
Well, this is an application that provides a random challenge for the user each time they load into it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
Android Studio
```

### Installing

```
N/A
```

## Coding Style
```
void codeStyle() {
    // Comments are below the handlebar.
    if (codeStyle == FALSE){ 
        // But above all other code.
        codeStyle.changeIt();
    }
}
```

## Commit Style
```
Capitalized, present tense, short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

- Bullet points are okay, too
